<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stores selected bytes from the source operand (first operand) into a 64-bit memory location. The mask operand (second operand) selects which bytes from the source operand are written to memory. The source and mask oper-ands are MMX technology registers. The memory location specified by the effective address in the DI/EDI/RDI register (the default segment register is DS, but this may be overridden with a segment-override prefix). The memory location does not need to be aligned on a natural boundary. (The size of the store address depends on the address-size attribute.)</p>
<p>The most significant bit in each byte of the mask operand determines whether the corresponding byte in the source operand is written to the corresponding byte location in memory: 0 indicates no write and 1 indicates write.</p>
<p>The MASKMOVQ instruction generates a non-temporal hint to the processor to minimize cache pollution. The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC) memory type protocol (see “Caching of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data” in Chapter 10, of the Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1). Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model, a fencing operation imple-mented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction should be used in conjunction with MASKMOVQ instructions if multiple processors might use different memory types to read/write the destination memory locations.</p>
<p>This instruction causes a transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology state (that is, the x87 FPU top-of-stack pointer is set to 0 and the x87 FPU tag word is set to all 0s [valid]).</p>
<p>The behavior of the MASKMOVQ instruction with a mask of all 0s is as follows:</p>
<p>The MASKMOVQ instruction can be used to improve performance for algorithms that need to merge data on a byte-by-byte basis. It should not cause a read for ownership; doing so generates unnecessary bandwidth since data is to be written directly using the byte-mask without allocating old data prior to the store.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, the memory address is specified by DS:RDI.</p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<pre>IF (MASK[7] = 1)
    THEN DEST[DI/EDI] := SRC[7:0] ELSE (* Memory location unchanged *); FI;
IF (MASK[15] = 1)
    THEN DEST[DI/EDI +1] := SRC[15:8] ELSE (* Memory location unchanged *); FI;
    (* Repeat operation for 3rd through 6th bytes in source operand *)
IF (MASK[63] = 1)
    THEN DEST[DI/EDI +15] := SRC[63:56] ELSE (* Memory location unchanged *); FI;</pre>
