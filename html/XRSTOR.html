<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Performs a full or partial restore of processor state components from the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the source operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components restored correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.</p>
<p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Soft-ware Developer’s Manual, Volume 1. Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, “x87 State” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.</p>
<p>Section 13.8, “Operation of XRSTOR,” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation of the XRSTOR instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p>
<p>for which RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 0.</p>
<p>Use of a source operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (for 64-bit and 32-bit modes) results in a general-protec-tion (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>
<p>See Section 13.6, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State,” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 for discussion of the bitmaps XINUSE and XMODIFIED and of the quantity XRSTOR_INFO.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>There is an exception if RFBM[1] = 0 and RFBM[2] = 1. In this case, the standard form of XRSTOR will load MXCSR from memory, even though MXCSR is part of state component 1 — SSE. The compacted form of XRSTOR does not make this exception.</p>
