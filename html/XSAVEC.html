<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the destination operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components saved correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.</p>
<p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Soft-ware Developer’s Manual, Volume 1. Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, “x87 State” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.</p>
<p>Section 13.10, “Operation of XSAVEC,” of Intel<em><sup>®</sup></em> 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVEC instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p>
<p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>There is an exception for state component 1 (SSE). MXCSR is part of SSE state, but XINUSE[1] may be 0 even if MXCSR does not have its initial value of 1F80H. In this case, XSAVEC saves SSE state as long as RFBM[1] = 1.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Unlike XSAVE and XSAVEOPT, XSAVEC clears bits in the XSTATE_BV field that correspond to bits that are clear in RFBM.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>There is an exception for state component 1 (SSE). MXCSR is part of SSE state, but XINUSE[1] may be 0 even if MXCSR does not have its initial value of 1F80H. In this case, XSAVEC sets XSTATE_BV[1] to 1 as long as RFBM[1] = 1.</p>
